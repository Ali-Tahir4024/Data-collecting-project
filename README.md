# Data-collecting-project
This project is simple data collection project and to practise JS local storage skills.In the HTML parts of this project there are different inputs to fill for the user to collect desired data from the user.In this project I have developed the functionality of searching the data the user has entered.The data which user enters is stored in the local storage of the browser.




Important JS functions and methods:
